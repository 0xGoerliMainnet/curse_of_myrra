# Curse of Myrra

We've just open sourced the repository. A lot of code reorganization needs to be done yet. We will be splitting the game from the actual backend-frontend framework we created. This process should be done before the end of July 2023.

- Elixir + Rust backend
- Unity frontend
- Websockets and Protobuff
